Salutations,

This is a basic movie website that shows several categories of movies; we can filter them in two ways: by countries and by languages. I have completed the project you gave me.

Every nation or language name has a checkbox next to it; if you tick it, the filter will change according to your selections.

Clicking on any movie image will launch a different website that displays an overview of the chosen film and has its own unique id as the path.
